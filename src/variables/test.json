        "text": "A player shared their experience of a familiar-looking NPC boarding their ship and not being able to get rid of them. The moment is inspiring lots of jokes about Bethesda games, and many Starfield fans are expressing they've gone through something similar. Starfield lets players explore space in a ship all their own. The ship serves as a sort of hub for the player, where Starfield crew and companions can be chatted with between ventures to the surface of planets. However, fans of the game and Bethesda's other works are accustomed to seeing weird glitches transpire, though this one may have a reason behind it. Starfield player justsodizzy took to Reddit to discuss the unwanted hitchhiker that they discovered on their ship. The NPC is a nameless citizen, and justsodizzy says that they simply appeared on their ship with no apparent reason for it. The citizen allegedly just \"babbles random nonsense\" when talked to, and the player couldn't figure out how to get rid of them. The citizen also just happens to bear a strong resemblance to Todd Howard, Director and Executive Producer at Bethesda. Explaining the Stowaway Citizen Fans in the comments have poked fun at the moment, joking about the Todd Howard lookalike and his presence on the player's ship.",

        "text": "Manchester United have been given a boost in their pursuit of Adrien Rabiot with the French star's mum claiming the player's camp are \"on excellent terms\" with Erik ten Hag's side. Rabiot's mum, Veronique, acts as his agent and in the aftermath of several failed moves to United, she revealed relations were still strong with the Red Devils despite Rabiot deciding against Old Trafford in the past. It now looks like a move for Rabiot could be back on with the player reportedly holding talks with United this week after finally calling time on his five-year stay with Juventus. The Frenchman, 29, became a free agent at the start of the month after running down his contract. Rabiot looked to be on the brink of a move to United while he was still a Paris-Saint Germain player only for then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to can the deal. A transfer then broke down in 2022, when allegations of huge wage demands saw Erik ten Hag opt for Casemiro instead. However, there is no ill will from Rabiot's camp with Veronique saying: \"We are on excellent terms with Manchester United.\"",

        "text": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Korey Lee said he didn’t expect to be traded before the deadline last summer, but he got dealt by the Astros for Kendall Graveman, giving the catching-starved Whjte Sox a much needed piece for their future. As multiple players in the Sox clubhouse are expecting or hoping to be traded in the next eight days, Lee probably shouldn’t be. The Sox have seen enough from him this season to believe they have capable backstop for years to come. And along with up-and-coming switch-hitter Edgar Quero at Triple-A Charlotte, a tandem with possibilities at arguably the most important position besides pitcher exists. Lee bounced back from an awful offensive showing last season to hit .273/.307/.421 in the first two months of the season. In June and July, however, he’s batting .158/.193/.307. “It’s time for him and I to understand what pitchers are trying to do with him,” hitting coach Marcus Thames said. “You have to make an adjustment, not try to do too much. “He’s a very aggressive hitter and teams know that now, so they’re not throwing him a strike early.",

As the Democratic Party continues to coalesce around her, Harris is traveling to Milwaukee, where she will hold her first campaign rally since she launched her campaign on Sunday with Biden's endorsement. Harris has raised more than $100 million since Sunday afternoon, and scored the backing of Democratic officials and political groups. Tuesday’s visit was scheduled before Biden ended his campaign, but took on new resonance as Harris prepared to take up the mantle of her party against Trump and looks to project calm and confidence after weeks of Democratic Party confusion over Biden's political future.",

Using data from NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft, scientists have determined that a 10-mile-thick diamond mantle may lie beneath the crust of Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. Mercury has long puzzled scientists as it possesses many qualities that aren't common to other solar system planets. These include its very dark surface, remarkably dense core, and the premature end of Mercury's volcanic era. Also among these puzzles are patches of graphite, a type of carbon on the surface of the innermost planet of the solar system.",
